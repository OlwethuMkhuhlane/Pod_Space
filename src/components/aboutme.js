            <p>
              I am Olwethu Lesley Mkhuhlane a former student of the University
              of the Western Cape, was pursuing a degree in Computer
              Science.Couldn’ t finish my degree because of financial issues.I
              am currently enrolled in a Co - Grammar bootcamp, in a 6 months
              course in web - development.I am currently residing in Philippi
              which falls under the Mitchell’ s Plains region, in Cape Town.I
              decided to pursue a career in programming because I fell in love
              with the programming(Software Development) aspect of it.Although
              that is not the only reason for choosing this career path, that is
              the main reason.I can program in a few of the well - known
              programming languages and such are mentioned in my resume.{" "}
              <br></br>
              As I mentioned that I am quite fond of problem solving and then
              translating those solutions to programs that can be used daily.I
              noticed that development involves getting hands - on programming
              experience in the corporate world, so it caught my interest.I
              believe I can work hard as everyone else but what sets me apart is
              the attitude and enthusiasm I have about my activities and task
              that have to do with work.That attitude is what drives me because
              I am quite fond of everything that has to do with Software
              Development, be it planning, documenting, coding and testing, I
              approach all of my tasks with the attitude that they are very
              important and must be paid attention to because they could be what
              decides the success of any project.
